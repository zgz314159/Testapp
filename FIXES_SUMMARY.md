# PracticeScreen and PracticeViewModel Error Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. PracticeScreen.kt - Val Reassignment Error
**Error**: `Val cannot be reassigned` for `sessionActualAnswered++`

**Root Cause**: The variable `sessionActualAnswered` was declared as `val` (immutable) but the code was trying to increment it with `++` operator.

**Solution**: Removed the increment operations (`sessionActualAnswered++`) since `sessionActualAnswered` is derived from the unified state and should not be manually modified. The session statistics are now automatically calculated from the `sessionState.sessionAnsweredCount`.

**Files Modified**:
- `PracticeScreen.kt` (line ~599): Removed `sessionActualAnswered++` from single/judgment question answering
- `PracticeScreen.kt` (line ~937): Removed `sessionActualAnswered++` from multiple choice question submission

### 2. PracticeViewModel.kt - QuestionUiModel Constructor Error
**Error**: `Cannot find a parameter with this name: answerStatus`

**Root Cause**: The QuestionUiModel constructor parameter was incorrectly named `answerStatus` instead of `status`.

**Solution**: Changed the parameter name from `answerStatus` to `status` in the QuestionUiModel constructor call.

**Files Modified**:
- `PracticeViewModel.kt` (line ~67): Fixed parameter name in QuestionUiModel creation

### 3. PracticeViewModel.kt - Boolean Type Mismatch
**Error**: `Type mismatch: inferred type is Boolean? but Boolean was expected`

**Root Cause**: The `isCorrect` property in QuestionWithState returns `Boolean?` (nullable), but was being used in a context expecting non-null `Boolean`.

**Solution**: Added proper null handling by using `questionWithState.isCorrect == true` instead of just `questionWithState.isCorrect`.

**Files Modified**:
- `PracticeViewModel.kt` (line ~72): Fixed null handling for isCorrect property

## Technical Notes

### Unified State Management
These fixes maintain the unified state management architecture where:
- All session statistics are computed from the central `_sessionState`
- Manual incrementing of derived values is avoided
- State consistency is preserved across the application

### Data Flow
- `sessionActualAnswered` is now purely derived from `sessionState.sessionAnsweredCount`
- Question answering automatically updates the unified state
- Session statistics are computed properties that update reactively

### Type Safety
- Proper nullable Boolean handling ensures type safety
- QuestionUiModel constructor uses correct parameter names
- All computed properties in QuestionWithState are properly handled

## Verification
- All compilation errors resolved
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Unified state management architecture preserved
- Session statistics calculation remains accurate

## Impact
- Eliminates "negative wrong answer count" bug potential
- Maintains architectural consistency
- Preserves all existing features
- Improves code maintainability
